# CodeAlpha_Task4_BasicChatbot

## Project Title:
*Basic Rule-Based Chatbot*

## Task:
CodeAlpha Internship – *Task 4: Basic Chatbot*

## Description:
This project is a *simple rule-based chatbot* built using *Python*.  
It interacts with the user through text inputs and provides predefined responses for common phrases such as greetings or simple questions.

The chatbot continues the conversation until the user types *“bye”, *“exit”*, or *“quit”**.

## Features:
- Responds to greetings like *“hi”, *“hello”*, and *“hey”**
- Answers basic questions such as *“how are you”* or *“what is your name”*
- Recognizes friendly replies like *“I am fine”, *“good”*, or *“great”**
- Ends the conversation gracefully when the user says *“bye”*
- Handles unrecognized inputs politely

## How It Works:
1. The user types a message in the console.
2. The chatbot compares the input with predefined rules.
3. It returns a suitable response or a default reply if not understood.
4. The conversation continues until the user ends it.

##  Example Interaction:
Welcome to the Basic Chatbot!
Type 'bye' to end the chat.

You:hello
Bot: Hi there! 
You:how are you
Bot: I'm fine, thanks! How about you?
You:i am fine
Bot: That’s nice to hear! 
You:bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!.
